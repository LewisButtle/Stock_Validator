TEAM MEMBERS: Stylianos Maimaris, Tim Marshall-Cox, Maciej Lulka, Folabi Ayonrinde, Josh Adams, Lewis Buttle  
CLIENT: Deutsche Bank  

A web-based solution verify that an input stock trade is correct, and no accidental extra values have been added. For example, the tool would prevent accidentally inputting £1000, if the intended input was £100.
This solution makes use of existing data and regression techniques to validate the inputs.  

Supporting documents are also included in the repository, including: 
- Installation Instructions: Instructions on how to set up and utilise the deliverable.
- Requirements Report: The derivation of the project requirements through discussions with Deutsche Bank representatives.
- Planning and Design Report: The pre-implementation report explaining and justifying how the deliverable will be implemented.
- Final Report: An overarching report of the project, which covers the entire project's lifespan.
