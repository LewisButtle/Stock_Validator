TEAM MEMBERS: Stylianos Maimaris, Tim Marshall-Cox, Maciej Lulka, Folabi Ayonrinde, Josh Adams, Lewis Buttle
CLIENT: Deutsche Bank

A web-based solution to validating that an input stock trade is correct, and no accidental extra values have been added. For example, preventing accidentally inputting £1000 instead of the intended £100 
This solution makes use of existing data and regression techniques to validate the inputs.

Supporting documents are also included in the repository, including:
Installation Instructions: Instructions on how to set up and utilise the deliverable.
Requirements Report: The derivation of the project requirements through discussions with Deutsche Bank representatives.
Planning and Design Report: The pre-implementation report explaining and justifying how the deliverable will be implemented.
Final Report: An overarching report of the project, which covers the entire project's lifespan.
